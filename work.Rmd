# Introduction {#sec:Intro}
Experiments were conducted as part of research into "The number of people living in a household".

1788 households were used in the experiments, and they each had their Annual household income in Philippine peso(Total.Household.Income), the region of the Philippines(Region), annual expenditure by the household on food in Philippine peso(Total.Food.Expenditure), head of the households sex(Household.Head.Sex), head of the households age in years(Household.Head.Age), relationship between the group of people living in the house(Type.of.Household), number of people living in the house(Total.Number.of.Family.members), floor area of the house(House.Floor.Area) in $m^2$, Age of the building in years(House.Age), number of bedrooms in the house(Number.of.bedrooms), whether the house have electricity with 1 is Yes and 0 is No)(Electricity).

No missing or undefined values are included in the dataset, and Total.Number.of.Family.members is given against the attributes of each household, including Total.Household.Income, Region, Total.Food.Expenditure, Household.Head.Sex, Household.Head.Age, Type.of.Household, House.Floor.Area, House.Age, Number.of.bedrooms and Electricity.

This dataset is helpful in a simple but illuminating research in understanding which household related variables may affect the number of people living in a household.

In particular, this report presents numerical and graphical summaries of the number of people living in a household, and shows which variables have an effect on the it. Then, a linear model was fitted to estimate the difference, on average, between the number of people living in a household of household head male and female, and among the number of people living in a household of three types of household.

# Summarize the Household.Head.Sex variable
data %>% group_by(Household.Head.Sex) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),Mean=round(mean(Total.Number.of.Family.members),digits=1), St.Dev=round(sd(Total.Number.of.Family.members),digits=1), # Summarize info

  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped","hold_position"))
```

Table \ref{tab:summarise1} shows that there are roughly fourth as many male household head in the sample (`r nrow(data[data$Household.Head.Sex=="Male",])` compared to `r nrow(data[data$Household.Head.Sex=="Female",])`). 
The summaries of the total number of family members of male household head were roughly similar with the corresponding summaries of female household head except mean. The mean of the total family members of male household head was `r round(mean(data[data$Household.Head.Sex=="Male",]$Total.Number.of.Family.members),1)` compared to `r round(mean(data[data$Household.Head.Sex=="Female",]$Total.Number.of.Family.members),1)` for female household head.

```{r}
# Summarize the Type.of.Household variable
data %>% group_by(Type.of.Household) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),Mean=round(mean(Total.Number.of.Family.members),digits=1), St.Dev=round(sd(Total.Number.of.Family.members),digits=1), # Summarize info
  Min=min(Total.Number.of.Family.members), Q1 = quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.25), Median=median(Total.Number.of.Family.members),
  Q3 = quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.75), Max=max(Total.Number.of.Family.members))%>%
  kbl(booktabs = T,caption = '\\label{tab:summarise2}Summary statistics on Total.Number.of.Family.members by the Type.of.Household')%>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped","hold_position"))
```

Table \ref{tab:summarise2} shows that there are significant difference in terms of the number of different household types in the sample, with (`r nrow(data[data$Type.of.Household=="Extended Family",])` extended family, `r nrow(data[data$Type.of.Household=="Single Family",])` single family and `r nrow(data[data$Type.of.Household=="Two or More Nonrelated Persons/Members",])` two or more nonrelated persons/members). 
The summaries of the total number of family members of single family were slightly lower than the corresponding summaries of other household types. For example, the means of the total family members of extended family, single family and two or more nonrelated persons/members were `r round(mean(data[data$Type.of.Household=="Extended Family",]$Total.Number.of.Family.members),1)`,`r round(mean(data[data$Type.of.Household=="Single Family",]$Total.Number.of.Family.members),1)` and `r round(mean(data[data$Type.of.Household=="Two or More Nonrelated Persons/Members",]$Total.Number.of.Family.members),1)` respectively.

# Summarize the Number.of.bedrooms variable
data %>% group_by(Number.of.bedrooms) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),Mean=round(mean(Total.Number.of.Family.members),digits=1), St.Dev=round(sd(Total.Number.of.Family.members),digits=1), # Summarize info
  Min=min(Total.Number.of.Family.members), Q1 = quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.25), Median=median(Total.Number.of.Family.members),
  Q3 = quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.75), Max=max(Total.Number.of.Family.members))%>%
  kbl(booktabs = T,caption = '\\label{tab:summarise3}Summary statistics on Total.Number.of.Family.members by the Number.of.bedrooms')%>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped","hold_position"))
```

Table \ref{tab:summarise3} shows that there are significant difference in terms of the number of bedrooms in the sample, with (`r nrow(data[data$Number.of.bedrooms==0,])` zero bedroom, `r nrow(data[data$Number.of.bedrooms==1,])` one bedroom, `r nrow(data[data$Number.of.bedrooms==2,])` two bedroomds, `r nrow(data[data$Number.of.bedrooms==3,])` three bedrooms, `r nrow(data[data$Number.of.bedrooms==4,])` four bedrooms, `r nrow(data[data$Number.of.bedrooms==5,])` five bedrooms and `r nrow(data[data$Number.of.bedrooms==6,])` six bedrooms). The summaries of the total number of family members of different number of bedrooms were different, mainly in terms of mean and max.

```{r}
# Summarize the Electricity variable
data %>% group_by(Electricity) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),Mean=round(mean(Total.Number.of.Family.members),digits=1), St.Dev=round(sd(Total.Number.of.Family.members),digits=1), # Summarize info
  Min=min(Total.Number.of.Family.members), Q1 = quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.25), Median=median(Total.Number.of.Family.members),
  Q3 = quantile(Total.Number.of.Family.members,0.75), Max=max(Total.Number.of.Family.members))%>%
  kbl(booktabs = T,caption = '\\label{tab:summarise4}Summary statistics on Total.Number.of.Family.members by the Electricity')%>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped","hold_position"))
```

Table \ref{tab:summarise4} shows that there are roughly fourth as many households with electricity in the sample (`r nrow(data[data$Electricity==1,])` compared to `r nrow(data[data$Electricity==0,])`). 
The summaries of the total number of family members of households with electricity were roughly similar with the corresponding summaries of households without electricity except mean and max. For example, the mean of the total family members of households without electricity was `r round(mean(data[data$Electricity==0,]$Total.Number.of.Family.members),1)` compared to `r round(mean(data[data$Electricity==1,]$Total.Number.of.Family.members),1)` for households with electricity.

```{r boxplot, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:box} Level.of.development and European.Union.Membership by Total.Number.of.Family.members respectively.", fig.pos = 'H'}
# Draw boxplots

  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x='Household.Head.Sext',y='Women.Entrepreneurship.Index')

  labs(x='Electricity',y='Total.Number.of.Family.members')

# Merge two boxplots
grid.arrange(box1,box2,box3,box4,nrow=2)
```
The top boxplot shows that female household head and single family household type have lower total number of family members.
Thus, the household head sex and type of household have significantly effect on the total number of family members.

Figure \ref{fig:plot1} displays scatterplots of total number of family members against total household income, total food expenditure, household head age, house floor area and house age respectively. Since there is one ourlier shown in these scatter plots, the outlier is excluded from the dataset and new scatterplots are displayed in the following.

All except household head age and house age have positive relationship with total number of family members.
